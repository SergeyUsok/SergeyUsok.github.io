### Playing with JavaScript, AngularJS, TypeScript, CSS, HTML and Bootstrap

Some features of TypeScript lang that were used during Game of Life implementation:

* abstract class
* enum
* interface
* **let** keyword
* field initialization in ctor
* [Symbol] iterator
* namespaces
* string interpolation (template strings)
* **yield** keyword
* **static** keyword (nothing special but let's put it here)
* generator functions with \*
* type aliases (**type** keyword)
* **declare** keyword (naive declaration of some JQuery functions)
* reference paths

What was NOT used and still requires to learn:

* generics
* modules
* tuples
* **async/await**
* promises
* union types (|)
* intersection types (&)
* enum flags
